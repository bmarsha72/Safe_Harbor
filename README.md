THE INCLUSIVE INITIATIVE is designed by Cam Iverson, Shawn Foster, and Brian Marshall.

The purpose of the site it to register businsesses that allow transgendered individuals to use their restroom
facilities without hassle from management.  It was originally intended for North Carolina, but the scope is now National, given 
the pending legislation in Mississippi.  

Users can enter a city, and find safe bathrooms within a reasonable radius (TBD).  Results are displayed on a map with 
addresses listed below.

Businesses can register using encrypted password access, list whether or not their bathrooms are single user, and if they
have multiple locations, designate a point of contact should the user require one.  

Uncopleteted tasks - back end doesn't record the correct latitude and longitude yet.  This is due using the wrong mapping API,
but should be completed soon.
SSL hasn't been implemented yet.
